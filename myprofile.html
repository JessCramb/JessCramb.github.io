  <h1> Welcome to my website</h1>
  
  <p>My name is Jessica Cramb, I am originally from Sydney and moved up to Brisbane around 13 years ago.  I am of Australian
    Aboriginal decent, with my mother being from the Monaro Ngarigo tribe and my father being from the Biripi tribe.  Whilst we
    do still speak a few words in our language, it is unfortunately not enough to pull together full sentences.</p>

  <p>During my first year out of high school I completed a Certificate IV in Business Administration and since then I have
    mostly worked in a business administration roles, with a few retail jobs and an overseas working holiday thrown in over the
    years.  I have been studying part time through Open Universities Australia for a few years and had recently taken a leave of
    absence to start a family.  During my leave I had a chance to reflect on my study so far and came to realise that the career
    path that the degree was taking me towards is not exactly for me, and so I have slightly shifted my focus and am now working
    towards the Bachelor of Information Technology.</p>

  <p>When I’m not working, studying or chasing after a one year old I like to spend time with my feather-baby Nibbler, who is a
    Nanday Conure.  Conures are a medium sized parrot that love scritches, cuddles and having a good chat.  Usually Nibbler is
    just babbling in birdy gibberish but he does have quite the vocabulary too, some phrases that I often hear include “peek-a
    boo”, “good boy”, “step up”, “what you doing bubby?” and “kiss kiss”.</p>

  <p>I am very excited to be continuing my education journey with RMIT and all my fellow students and cannot wait to be able to
    apply all my new skills to the real world.</p>
