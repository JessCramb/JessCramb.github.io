## True Colours Personality Test
True Colours is a personality test which categorises people into four colours;
* Blue represents those that are driven by emotions and tend to be more creative.
* Gold represents the most loyal personalities, these are people who follow the rules.
* Orange are the adventurous people and tend to be impulsive, driven by short term goals.
* Green are the analytical people, these people thrive on logic and tend to be the most focused.

Upon completion of this test I am very happy to report that I rate very highly in the green category. Having shown a preference for logic over emotions and the drive to find the best way to complete a task.
